\item{cabic}{A biclustering object of class "caclust"
as obtained from `caclust`.}

\item{universe}{All genes in data set.}

\item{org}{Short name of the organism. "mm" for mouse, "hs" for human.}

\item{set}{Name of the gene set. Currently only supports "CellMarker"}

\item{min_size}{Min. number of genes in the gene set.}

\item{max_size}{Max number of genes in the gene set.
Set to Inf if you want to keep all genes.}

\description{
per_cluster_goa loads the required gene set, formats it and performs

object.
